the current task at hand goes as follows

at the following path : .data\old
there is the old smap

my goal is to rewrite it to be more secure, stealthy, accurate and consistent in its abiltiy to work and well formatted and designed in a professional manner

my first goal is to do utils, i tried to convert what i could from utils.cpp/h from the old project to the utils currently in : src\utils
but they were not consistently writen, were badly written, and didn't capture all of what should be included, this features whats in the ext folder ( 3 useful projects )
and the code these files were extremely fragile and unlikely to work with the latest version which requires you to reread the docs and exposed apis of these 3 projects
than read the old utils, than focus on creating the perfect utils

this is a 9 step process that likes much reverification and active steps to ensure correct and proper usage
